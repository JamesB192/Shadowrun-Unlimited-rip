Shadowrun Unlimited is an expansive mod for Shadowrun Returns. It is an entirely original story and aims to create a "sandbox" Shadowrun experience. It is heavily influenced by Shadowrun 
for the Sega Genesis, so if you were a fan of that game, make sure to check this out. The project has been named "Unlimited" because it doesn't have a specific "end" point, and will continue to expand and evolve over time until it is a fully realized Shadowrun simulation."

### Shadowrun Unlimited is designed to be more than a simple campaign; it's the world of Shadowrun.

* Sandbox style gameplay. 
* Replayable Runs, assigned randomly by fixers from their "pool" of runs. The number of runs is around 30, and growing with each new update.
* Players gain Street Cred for completing runs, along with Karma and Nuyen rewards. Street Cred allows the player to access higher level fixers and merchants.
* Completing runs will cause the player to gain both Heat and Notoriety. Heat causes Lone Star to spawn with greater frequency, and Notoriety will cause them to attack you on sight (once a certain threshold is reached). Heat can also be increased by setting off alarms during runs. 
* Players can rent a variety of Safe Houses. Safe houses allow the player to rest and recover their health, as well as lower their Heat rating. More expensive safe houses provide access to cheap support items, more efficient healing, and eventually character buffs. Players can purchase an upgradeable safe house and customize it as they see fit.
* Assault Rifles, SMG's and Shotguns are illegal. If the Lone Star stops you with one of these weapons they will attempt an arrest, violently. This can be avoided by acquiring a forged Weapon Permit.
* Players can buy DocWagon contracts, which allow them to respawn inside the same zone upon death. The better the contract, the more respawns that are allowed, and the cheaper the service charge. This is however optional for new characters that are having trouble making ends meet.
* Characters with high Charisma are able to negotiate for a little something extra when they are offered a job.
* Designed for new characters. Slower paced gameplay, with money "sinks". Don't expect to max out your character in one sitting, and getting started in Seattle isn't going to be easy. But once you get your feet wet, you'll be making steady money.
* A Taxi System that can be used to travel between all the hub zones.
* NPC runners can be hired and follow you throughout the world until the job is complete (or they are defeated). Players no longer hire runners on a per-map basis. Getting runners killed will increase their future hiring costs, but performing successful runs with them will level it back out.
* A Commlink System that allows players to call their contacts, such as fixers, runners, and of course the taxi. Runners hired over the phone will arrive at the player's location within a few seconds. *The Commlink is accessed by clicking on your character, outside of combat.
* There is a basic journal system built in. Whenever you activate your commlink, a brief message will appear guiding you in the right direction.
* A day and night cycle to help bring the world to life. Watch the sun rise and set as you sit idle. Transitioning zones speeds up the process. Some encounters will only happen during certain times of the day.
* A branching story that will take players down different paths depending upon the choices they make. These choices will exclude other options, and create proper repercussions to decisions. And once this story runs it's course, I will begin building another. No need to import characters into a new UGC, you can just wake up in your Safehouse and kick off your next adventure.
* A global Matrix that can be accessed from any jack-points in the world (aside from run maps). Deckers can now hack into the Matrix before a run starts and open MagLock doors, disable security cameras, and more before the team arrives at the run location. When not hacking the Matrix for a run, deckers can earn extra cash by delving into data nodes and retrieving files. There is a certain fixer hanging his hat Downtown that is willing to pay for stolen data files.
* Six special matrix programs, that act like matrix-only attributes. Masking, Exploit, Spoof, Delete, Edit, and Browse. They expand the potential of the matrix, as well as expanding decker growth potential beyond the two skills. Players can now upgrade their Deck Storage to allow for more data files to be downloaded when raiding Datastore.
* A unique system is hidden in the world that allows players to weaken their characters in exchange for special rewards, effectively allowing infinite karma spending.
* Integrated Tracker's Street Samurai's Catalogue. Fleshed out the rest of the items such as spells and cyberdecks to fall in-line with the same financial scale as Tracker's cyberware.
* Created 5 new Skills to expand how the game is played: Stealth, Negotiation, Fast-Talking, Electronics, and Lockpicking.
* This UGC is not "finished". The current story is not complete, and the world is not completely "fleshed out". This is completely playable, but is under a constant state of development with on average, a large update every week (not including bug fixes). This game will probably never be "done" as I will always be expanding upon it, so don't be afraid to jump in now.
* If you like this UGC don't forget to give it a thumbs up! And if you have any ideas, or would like to lend a hand, look at the discussions below and... well you should be able to figure it out. ENJOY!

### Helping

If you understand the Shadowrun Returns game editor, let [JamesB192](https://github.com/JamesB192) or [bdfworks](https://github.com/bdfworks) know if you're ready to help with any bugs. We use GitHub. If not familiar with it, try to get thru these tutorials on your own to see if its worth the difficulty for you; otherwise, might be better to stick to creating your own separate mods we can add to it. (James doesn't have much time anymore to commit to much help with the project, and bdfworks may still be too inexperienced with the GitHub client to help much...sorry... :( ...)

1. Create an account with GitHub at github.com.
2. Then follow the first tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
3. Then learn how to work with someone else's project: https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/ (warning, it's out of date, or was different for Win 7)
