  description: "This seems to be a normal very good condition roman helmet. The helmet itself isn\'t even magical, just a nice antique. However, the horse hair plume attached to it is magical. The magic seems to be related to summoning, travel, and of all things necromancy. Touching the plume feels more like touching a living horses mane. The hair is strangely soft and fine."
