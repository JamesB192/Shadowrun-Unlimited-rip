  description: "From a distance spotting the clay figure that vaguely resembles a primitive fertility goddess, you wonder why it\'s here, Getting closer you don\'t wonder anymore, you just want it for yourself. Not super strongly, you just do. With its obvious magical nature, you can tell it\'s a low power compulsion field. Not strong, but enough to get the job done without being too noticeable. You also get the feeling that\'s not all it does."
