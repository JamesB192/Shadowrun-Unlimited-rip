  name: "Theft Target 8 - Sewing Needle"
  description: "A small plain silver sewing needle. It probably wouldn\'t even be in this collection if it didn\'t belong to someone famous.  Although you don\'t know who. It is magical, although you only noticed as you were actively looking. Its magic aura is shadowy, nebulous, and easy to overlook. It seems to be related to binding in some way."
