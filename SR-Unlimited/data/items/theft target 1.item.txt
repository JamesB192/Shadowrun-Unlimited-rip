  description: "At first glance, it just looks like an old notched sword. Just an antique. It doesn\'t even appear sharp. But testing the edge it cuts like it\'s razor-sharp. Combined with the notches it has a serrated quality. To magical senses, it feels...sharp. Almost like it\'s cutting the senses themselves. The hilt isn\'t gaudy, but it is fancy enough that it makes the sword an obvious collector's item."
