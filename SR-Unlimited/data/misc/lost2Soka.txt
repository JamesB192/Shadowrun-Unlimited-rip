Defeat.

You wish you had died. Soka applied a slap patch and a pair of handcuff to keep you alive and contained on the way back to Renraku. There they rip your mind. Conversion to a cyberzombie soon follows and your personal 
destruction of all your allies. Eventually you are sent to retrieve the box from the place where it was entombed and hand the curse thing to Soka.
