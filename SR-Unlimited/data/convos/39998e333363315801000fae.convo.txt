  text: "Good you break into a mansion, steal some unappreciated mgical item, set fire to the place than get out. Apparently the owner showed his collection of \"antiques\" to the wrong person. They noticed some of them are magic and got offended they were just sitting there with other junk. So we retrieve them, then set fire to the place. Partly for vengeance, mostly for confusion. By the time the smoke clears the artifacts will be hidden away. The client doesn\'t care how loud it is, but Lonestar actual cares about these rich drek heads. The job pays \302\245$(story.Pay).Also make sure to bring a mage or shaman to identify what is magic. Finally meet the Johson in Downtown near where the exit to Northside is. Finally you can\'t bail on this job once taken."
